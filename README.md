# Ruby shopping list
## About
An easy app created with Ruby. Allows the user to create a list (shopping list but it can be also a "to do" list). User can add and delete items or tasks, check or uncheck the items (if the task is complete or not) and remove all entries in the list.
## The project
I created this as a excercise to learn Ruby, there are very useful things to know like classes (with methods) and a simple user interface
## To run the app
You need to have Ruby install in your computer, and then just run "ruby list_app.rb" in the console.
